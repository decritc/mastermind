# Mastermind

Mastermind game school project 

# Requirements
 Create a program that will mimic the Mastermind game.  Given a number of colors and number 
 of pins possible for the secret code (given by user or random), give the player only half 
 as many possible guesses to solve the code.

# Installation
Installation of cocos2d-x requires python 2.7 which you can download for your machine at:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/

Install cocos2d-x:
Download the latest version of Cocos2d-x at www.cocos2d-x.org/download
Open a terminal or command line and type:

cd ~/cocos2d-x-3.5/

python setup.py

execute the command prompted by setup.py

Then create a new project by issuing the following command:

cocos new -l cpp -d ~/Mastermind

Open the newly created project and replace the Classes and Resources folder with the ones 
found here.

# Known issues
Currently 12 guess option is not implemented however difficulty rating will compute and you can start the game only it will only give you 8 guesses.
